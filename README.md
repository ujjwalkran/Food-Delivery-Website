FoodBear is a web application for ordering food online. It allows users to browse through various restaurants, choose dishes from their menus, and place an order for delivery or pickup. The application also has features such as real-time order tracking, payment processing, and user reviews. It aims to simulate the working of a database centric web application to order food. A connection between the database and the User Interface is done and the User Interface interacts with the database efficiently, by means of Stored Procedures and Functions.
